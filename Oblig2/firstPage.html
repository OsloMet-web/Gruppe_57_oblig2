        <h2 class="sub-header">The Top Tech Leaders</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">A delegation of top tech leaders including Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman convened in Washington on Wednesday for a closed-door meeting with US senators to discuss the rise of artificial intelligence and how it should be regulated.
             The discussion, billed as an “AI safety forum”, is one of several meetings between Silicon Valley, researchers, labor leaders and government and is taking on fresh urgency with the US elections looming and the rapid pace of AI advancement already affecting people’s lives and work.
             The Democratic senator Chuck Schumer, who called the meeting “historic”, said that attendees loosely endorsed the idea of regulations but that there was little consensus on what such rules would look like.
             Schumer said he asked everyone in the room – including more than 60 senators, almost two dozen tech executives, advocates and skeptics – whether government should have a role in the oversight of artificial intelligence, and that “every single person raised their hands, even though they had diverse views”.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-header">The Ideas</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Among the ideas discussed was whether there should be an independent agency to oversee certain aspects of the rapidly developing technology, how companies could be more transparent and how the US can stay ahead of China and other countries.
            “The key point was really that it’s important for us to have a referee,” said Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, during a break in the forum. “It was a very civilized discussion, actually, among some of the smartest people in the world.”
            Congress should do what it can to maximize the benefits and minimize the negatives of AI, Schumer told reporters, “whether that’s enshrining bias, or the loss of jobs, or even the kind of doomsday scenarios that were mentioned in the room. And only government can be there to put in guardrails”.
            Attendees also discussed the pressing need for steps to protect the 2024 US elections from disinformation becoming supercharged by AI, Schumer said.
            “The issue of actually having deepfakes where people really believe that somebody, that a campaign was saying something when they were the total creation of AI” was a key concern, said Schumer, and that “watermarking” – badging content as AI generated – was discussed as a solution.
